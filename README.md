# space_Invaders
A discord bot thet lets you play Space invaders.

It is my first discord bot... so please give any suggestions to improve it :]

# Commands in this bot:

* `$hello`: Just to make the bot greet you.

* `$help`: Just for fun.

* `$play`: To play SPACE INVADERS.

* `$stop`: To stop playing SPACE INVADERS.

* `$leaderboard`: Show players' high scores list.

# Install instructions:
Download the latest Source code.<br>
Rename `.env.EXAMPLE` with `.env`.<br>
Then, create a Discord Bot Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and replace `your_token_here` in `.env` file with your discord bot token.<br>
Add the bot to your server with all text permissions using the url generated by OAuth2 URL generator in the Discord Bot Application page.
<!-- The code will work with python 3.8 -->
Then, Download python 3.8 and install required dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Finally execute the run.py and the bot will become online on your server :]
