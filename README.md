A discord bot thet lets you play Space invaders.

It is my first discord bot... so please give any suggestions to improve it :]

# Commands in this bot:

* `$help`: Just for fun.

* `$play`: To play SPACE INVADERS.

* `$stop`: To stop playing SPACE INVADERS.

* `$leaderboard`: Show players' high scores list.

# Install instructions:
Download the latest Source code.<br>
<!-- The code will work with python 3.8 -->
Download python 3.8 and install required dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Finally execute the run.py, follow what it says and your bot should be online :]
